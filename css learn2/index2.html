        <h2>GOOD MORNING</h2>
        <h1>History of Nature</h1>
        <h3>A note on Natures archive:-</h3>
        <p>Nature’s archive comprises all the content published since the journal’s launch in 1869;  
            it includes some images, articles and language that by twenty-first-century standards are offensive and 
            harmful, including sexist, racist and other discriminatory content. This content does not represent Nature’s current values 
            and would be unacceptable to publish today. 
            We have not sought to suppress it because it is part of the scientific and historical record, and so should remain available for scholars now and in the future. 
            Nature is committed to making the changes necessary to ensure that it learns from its past and creates a publication that champions science for everyone.</p>
